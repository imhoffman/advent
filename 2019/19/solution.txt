slope of inner edge:  m1 = 18
slope of outer edge:  m2 = 6

for a closest corner at x = x2 - 100, y = y1

(y1 - 37)  = m1 * (x1 - 4)
(y1 - 46)  = m2 * (x2 - 8)
(y1 + 100 - 37) = m1 * (x2 - 100 - 4)

y = 964 or 965
x = 161 - 100 = 61  or 62

640983 is too low ... probably an indexing/pixelation problem
but 650983 is too low, too

found an algebra error, but it brings x even lower ... ?
